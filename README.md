# Week 4 Demo
TextWrap is a powerful library for word wrapping, indenting, and dedenting strings. And this week I  wirte a rust cli tool to wrapping the user input 

For example:
cargo run -- text-wrap --name "If you need a small quick library that knows how to wrap text for command line utilities, take a look at this crate."

If you need

a small quick

library that

knows how to

wrap text for

command line

utilities,

take a look at

this crate.
